  p Reflect Scientific offers three different types of purifiers for removal of moisture, hydrocarbon, and oxygen from carrier gases.
  br 
  p All have been proven cost effective in preventing column degradation, eliminating baseline drift and maximizing the accuracy of analytical data.
  br 
  p They have been designed for optimum rate and breakthrough capacity. For best overall results in contaminant removal they should be used in combination.
  br
  p Custom manufacturing of purification devices is also available. We can handle a diverse range of chamber designs with materials of construction such as Aluminum, Stainless Steel, Teflon and Polycarbonate.
