  p The VUV-40F is a dual beam, fixed wavelength, optical absorbance detector for liquid chromatography. The OEM module can be configured in a variety of ways from standalone operation to incorporation into a dedicated analyzer. Choice of light source includes: Hg and D2 lamps for UV absorbance and high intensity LEDs for the visible range.
  br
  p A series of sample cell options are also available from preparative to micro volume. Standard data output formats available are USB, RS232 and IEE488. Typical applications are in HPLC systems, dedicated analyzers and private label instrumentation.

        h2 Variety of light sources
        p The VUV-40F can be configured with Hg, LED, Deuterium or Xenon light sources allowing a wide selection of light throughput, wavelength selection, power and sizes to fit any application.

        h2 Dual beam
        p Compact patented design keeps the optical unit small but with the performance of larger instruments. This allows smaller dedicated OEM designs or smaller footprint for stand-alone instruments.

        h2 Advanced electronics
        p High-resolution output can be accessed by USB or IEE488 protocols. Fully programmable parameters using a host computer are permanently stored in non-volatile memory. Easily integrated with OEM analytical systems. Stand-alone operation configuration for private label instruments is also available.
