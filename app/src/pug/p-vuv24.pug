  p The VUV-24 is a variable wavelength light absorbance monitor designed to be used with ultra low volume sampling cells under flowing solvent conditions (i.e. chromatography). The VUV-24 series of detectors has a high resolution analog output with a sensitivity range from 4.0 AU/V to 0.0005 AU/V and feature a state-of-the-art noise level of less than +/-0.00001 AU.

      h2 High Sensitivity
      p The VUV-24 series of detectors has a high-resolution analog output with sensitivity range from 4.0 AU/V to 0.0005 AU/V and feature a state-of-the-art noise level of less than +/-0.00001 AU
    div
      h2 Flexible Configurations
      p The VUV-24 can be configured to use one of several light sources. Choices include a deuterium lamp with a working wavelength range from 190 nm to 400 nm, low pressure mercury lamp with a single wavelength of 254 nm, and a tungsten lamp that accommodates wavelengths from 400 nm to 900 nm. Specific wavelengths are selected by using an interference filter. One filter is included with each detector. <br>The VUV-24 has a broad line of sample cells available. These include cells designed for on column capillary monitoring, standard and high flow 5 mm and 10 mm path length HPLC cells, and preparative LC. Whatever your application the VUV-24 can serve as a reliable source for obtaining the results you want.

      h2 Reliable, Rugged, Low Maintenance Design
      p The VUV-24 is constructed with a high reliability lamp, true double beam sample/reference light paths and a robust universal power supply. A rugged tactile feedback keypad for instrument control is standard.
    div
      h2 Wavelength Selection
      p The deuterium lamp has a working wavelength range from 190 nm to 400 nm. Specific wavelengths are selected by using a keypad input or RS-232 interface.
